# Documentation for `NuGas`

This directory contains the following [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) that illustrate how to use `NuGas`:

## `f2i`: Two-Flavor, Isotropic and Homogeneous Model
- `bipolar.ipynb` demonstrates the basic usage of the `nugas.f2i` package with the examples of the flavor oscillations in the bipolar system.  
- `spectral-splits.ipynb` shows how to use `nugas.f2i` to study the 2-flavor oscillations in a homogeneous and isotropic neutrino gas with the examples of spectral splits and the single-angle neutrino oscillation model for supernovae.

## `f2e0d1a`: Two-Flavor, Energy Independent, One-Dimensional, Axisymmetric Model
- `dispersion-relations.ipynb` shows how to compute the flavor isospin wave solutions and their dispersion relations for the 1D axisymmetric model.
- `fast-oscillations.ipynb` demonstrates how to solve the equation of motion numerically.
